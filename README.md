# C4.5DecisionTree
3rd year project - Does Feature Selection Improve the Performance of Machine Learning?

Machine learning has many applications in diverse fields of industry, e.g. preventing
fraud, self-driving cars, giving relevant and useful online recommendations, fast speech
recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human
genome. It is often assumed that some features of the data are more informative than
others and that the performance of a pattern recognition system is often improved by
eliminating less informative features (a process known as "Feature Selection"). The
study particularly focuses on investigating whether feature selection improves the learning
performance of machine learning. This project implements the C4.5 decision tree
algorithm as a machine learning model to be evaluated with regards to the effects of
feature selection. The results demonstrate feature selection was found to have positive
effects on the classification model employed, but it is still at too much of a preliminary
stage to draw any further conclusions from since the results obtained may not apply to
other machine learning models.
